# Using Ruby

In this exercise we are going to practice using the basic types of Ruby and using a Ruby file to save our work.

For each point below use `puts` to print to the Terminal a description of the object you're about to print, then `puts` the object itself. For example the first one should look like:

```
puts "An Integer"
puts 42
```

- An Integer
- A String
- A Symbol
- An Array
- A Hash
- An Array with each of these five types an elements within it
- A Hash with each of the five types as keys
- An Array with only pre-assigned variables of any type within it.
- Interpolate a String variable within another String
- A Hash with a value that is a Hash with a value that is a Hash.
