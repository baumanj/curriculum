# Git Warmup

Practice your git skills by doing the following:

<small>(remember to google, ask questions, and look at resources listed in the lecture notes)</small>

- Create a new git repo in a directory called `animals`
- Create a file called `cat.rb` with the following code:

```rb
class Cat
  def speak
    puts "Meow"
  end
end
```

- Stage the `cat.rb` file
- Make a commit with the message `"Add the cat class"`
- Now make files called `dog.rb`, `leaf.rb`, and `otter.rb` (What do you think should go in these files?)
- Stage all of those files.
- Make a commit with the message `"Add classes for other animals"`
- Remove the `leaf.rb` file from git.
- Stage the deletion
- Make a commit with the message `"Remove leaf class because it's not an animal"`
- Create a repo on Github for this warmup
- Connect the repo on github with your local repo
- Push to github
