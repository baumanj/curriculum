words = {

}

"Hello #{words[:name]}! It's really good to be in #{words[:place]}. I love the local #{words[:season]} season. I can't wait to eat #{words[:foods][0]}, #{words[:foods][1]}, and #{words[:foods][2]}. Last night we saw the comedian #{words[:performer]}, I laughed so hard I nearly died #{'lol' * words[:times_i_laughed]}... Anyway my #{words['vehicle']} is ariving in #{words[:minutes_to_vehicle]} minutes. #{words[:goodbye]}"
