As some random website on the internet says
> A photo, such as a professional and creative headshot—something that captures who you are.

> A mission statement or personal summary. Try to stay away from official resume-speak and get people excited about what excites you. (Mine includes “I help nonprofits and companies show the impact of their work, inspire action from their audience, and communicate more effectively.”)

> Links to your professional social media profiles, such as LinkedIn, your blog, Twitter, or a Facebook page. Remember though, if you don’t want a recruiter finding something (for example, if your Facebook profile is just for friends and family), don’t put it on your profile.

>Your contact information—tell people where they can reach you, whether it’s via email, Twitter, or another preferred method.

>That’s all you really need to get started—but of course, feel free to add links to your work, your resume, a bio, you name it! It can be helpful to search for people in your field who are also on the platform of your choice and browse their sites to get inspiration for your own page.

>Now, all that’s left to decide is—which photo gets the big spot?
